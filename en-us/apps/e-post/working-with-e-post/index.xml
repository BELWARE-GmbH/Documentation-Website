        <description>Working with E-POST Sending The document types supported by our app can be found summarized in the introduction.In our example we focus on posted sales invoices. All other documents can be processed the same way.

        <description>Working with the E-POST API Archive After sending the invoice, you can check the status in the joblist. This can be found in the factbox area directly on the overview of the documents. Here you can see when the letter was sent, who sent it and what the status is.
In the factbox area of the documents you can find the Connector 365 Activities. There you find the brief overview to each process.</description>
