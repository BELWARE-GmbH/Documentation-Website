        <description>Upgrade from Connector 365 setup Please check the prerequisites before proceeding.
The Joblist logs all activities performed as part of the Connector NAV/BC functions.
The Connector 365 Apps use a similar table (Connector 365 Activities) to record any activities.
However, as the two tables are not identical, a process is required to transfer the data from the Joblist to the Connector 365 Activities list.
The Connector 365 Upgrade app provides a function for data synchronisation.</description>

The communication matrix of the Connector NAV/BC contains, if maintained, setup data that determines if and how documents for individual customers, vendors or contacts are processed. In the product series Connector 365 (Business Central versions &amp;gt; 14), the communication matrix is no longer available as a separate table.
