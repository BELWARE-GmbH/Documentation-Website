        <description>Installation OnPrem You will receive the Connector 365 Upgrade App from us by mail as a runtime package suitable for your system. In order for you to use the app, it must first be published and then installed.
Since the app is only necessary if you are moving from a legacy system with Connector NAV/BC to a system with Connector 365 Apps, it is assumed here that the Connector 365 Base App is already installed on your system.</description>
