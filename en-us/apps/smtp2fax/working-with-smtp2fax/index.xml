        <description>The SMTP2FAX Dialog If for a report the delivery as a fax via SMTP was activated, a mail dialog adapted for the fax application appears for further processing.
Here the recipient address can be changed and the attachment can be checked for correctness. Then the report can be sent or discarded via the respective button in the upper menu. If the dialog is closed via the X or the close button, it is still possible to select whether the message is to be saved as a draft in the mail outbox or discarded.</description>
