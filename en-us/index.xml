        <description>Installation OnPrem You will receive the Connector 365 Upgrade App from us by mail as a runtime package suitable for your system. In order for you to be able to use the app, it must first be published and then installed.
As the app is only necessary if you switch from a legacy system with Connector NAV/BC to a system with Connector 365 Apps, it is assumed here that the Connector 365 Base App is already installed on your system.</description>

        <description>Test &amp;amp; Purchase OnPrem It is not necessary to purchase the app, as it is only suitable for existing customers who used a system up to BC14, already used Connector NAV/BC on it and then switched to a newer system with Connector 365 apps.
For this customer group, the use of the app is included in the maintenance costs.
A test phase is therefore also unnecessary, especially as the app is ideally only used once.</description>

To do this, open one of the desired document pages: e.g. sales orders.
After navigating to the page you can post the selected documents as usual using the action Post&amp;hellip;.
Afterwards the created posted sales invoice and/or posted sales shipment will be enqueued to be processed, as long as the automated processing is enabled for this document type in the Easy Batch Setup.</description>

If wished, you must hide the border lines when you are done with your table.Place holder in body texts For an email body text template, you can use place holders for components that are individual to each employee, for example, name or email address.</description>

OnBeforeSetRecordFilterForEmailPlaceholders 1 2 - var TargetTableNumber: Integer - ReportId: Integer As described in the setup, for reports which use as first DataItem not the header of the respective report usage, unusable fields may appear in the lookup of each placeholder.
Using the event from the BELMSP EmailSubjectPlaceholder page, you can set the correct target table yourself for the respective used report.</description>

        <description>Working with XRechnung Events We offer you the possibility to link into our programming logic with events, here we describe how this works.
To subscribe an event for sales invoices or service invoices, the XML port BEL365 S. Inv. XRechnung 2.0 must be specified in an EventSubscriber.
Beispiel:
For sales credit notes or service credit notes, the following XML port must be entered: BEL365 S. Cr. M. XRechnung 2.0.

        <description>Example progress password assignment By assigning passwords, you can protect sentitive content when it is sent. Because an unprotected PDF file is comparable to a postcard - anyone who has access can read it. You have various options for assigning passwords.
Function „Show password“ Of course, it is important that passwords remain protected - however, it can happen that passwords are forgotten or misplaced. For this case there is a function &amp;ldquo;Show password&amp;rdquo; - this function, which can be assigned on a user basis, allows to view the password of PDF files.</description>

        <description>Job files and feedback massages This chapter is only relevant for licensing an interface with external communication software (OfficeMaster, Twinfax, Tobit, Faxmaker, C3000).
After the dialog has been confirmed with OK, the Connector NAV stores a text file in the path com_job and the job identifier from Connector NAV Setup. This is picked up and processed by the communication software. Afterwards the software returns a feedback file. This is located under com_ack or com_err.</description>

        <description>So where do the recipients&amp;rsquo; e-mail addresses come from? (Using without target and communication matrix) The Connector NAV / 365 BC works analogously to the standard dispatch. We will use various examples to explain how the mail dispatch process works. For the following 3 examples we limit ourselves to the report Quotations. The service recipient is the same as the invoice recipient. The process is the same for each report.</description>

        <description>Routing ID As mentioned earlier, the routing ID is used to uniquely identify invoice recipients to enable addressing and, if necessary, routing of electronic invoices to the correct administrative units. Basically, a routing ID consists of the following components:
Coarse addressing
Fine addressing (optional)
Check digit
Further information on the structure of a routing ID can be found here.
The Connector is able to check the syntax of a route ID for correctness.</description>

CON365, VIEW
This basically allows users to interact with the app and send receipts with automatic attachments.
CON365, EDIT
In the case of the Easy Document Pin app, this set provides the same permissions as VIEW.
CON365, SETUP
This permission set is necessary to make changes to the app setup and should be assigned to the administrator.</description>

        <description>Upgrade from Connector 365 setup Please check the prerequisites before proceeding.
The Joblist logs all activities performed as part of the Connector NAV/BC functions.
The Connector 365 Apps use a similar table (Connector 365 Activities) to record any activities.
However, as the two tables are not identical, a process is required to transfer the data from the Joblist to the Connector 365 Activities list.
The Connector 365 Upgrade app provides a function for data synchronisation.</description>

        <description>Accompanying documents The XRechnung standard allows attachments to accompany invoices.
This standard allows attachments of the following MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) types:
Application/pdf (.pdf)
Image/png (.png)
Image/jpeg (.jpg)
Text/CSV (.csv)
Application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheethtml.sheet (.xslx)
Excel tables
Application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.spreadsheet (.ods)
OpenDocument tables
PDF attachments may be considered insecure by some clients and are accordingly marked as such by XRechnung Portal Deutschland. To avoid this, it is recommended to use PDF/A files instead. These have a higher security level and are therefore also classified as secure attachments by the portal.</description>

        <description>Deviating dispatch - using the destination address matrix The previous examples all worked without the matrix because direct related contacts were always accessed.
Now, however, there is a deviating company logic. The service recipient is not the same as the invoice recipient, but a different company. Also the customers/suppliers play a role in the destination address. Despite person contact, there is a desire to send documents but basically to deviating/global addresses.</description>

        <description>Upgrade of communication matrix (CON Communication Matrix) Introduction Please check the prerequisites before proceeding.
The communication matrix of the Connector NAV/BC contains, if maintained, setup data that determines if and how documents for individual customers, vendors or contacts are processed. In the product series Connector 365 (Business Central versions &amp;gt; 14), the communication matrix is no longer available as a separate table.
Instead, the Document Layouts are used for similar facilities.</description>

        <description>Send XRechnung directly by e-mail (Connector e-mail module) If you have also installed the Connector365 module Email, you can send an XRechnung directly by e-mail through the Connector after it has been generated. For this you have to make an adjustment in the communication matrix.
Simply change the value of the Job Mode field from PDF to Email. In addition, you can optionally enter a default destination address. Now the marked invoice can be converted to XRechnung format via the Email button, or via the Batch button, if the batch mode entry has been marked, and sent on directly via e-mail.</description>

        <description>Optimizations: Outlook N-recipient addresses
When storing additional destination addresses, which were neither created as CC nor BCC, the address was previously taken as CC instead of the desired equivalent in the &amp;ldquo;To&amp;rdquo; field. This is now corrected.
Consideration of matrix printers
During batch processing, the additional printers from the communication matrix were not taken into account in the Print job mode. Now it is possible to use these printers as well.</description>

        <description>Analyze validation results in case of error During the validation of the XRechnung file, it can of course also happen that an XRechnung is classified as non-compliant. This happens when important information is missing from the invoice. For example, validation will fail even if the customer&amp;rsquo;s city is not specified.
To simulate a case where validation fails, we modify the above procedure to &amp;ldquo;forget&amp;rdquo; to specify a routing ID. To do this, we again open the Communication Matrix for our example calculation 103003, and remove the value for the route ID.</description>

        <description>Further information on troubleshooting In this documentation, a possible case of an incorrect validation was shown as an example. In addition to the problem shown there with the routing ID, there are several other sources of errors. Therefore, it is enormously advantageous to use a validation service, as otherwise errors may only be noticed in one of the invoice portals or by the invoice recipient.

        <description>Set up your own validator As already mentioned in the XRechnung section of the documentation, BELWARE&amp;rsquo;s XRechnung module uses a service to validate invoices and credit notes in XRechnung format. Here, a configurable XML validation tool is used, which was published for the first time by KoSIT (Koordinierungsstelle für IT).
In combination with the appropriate configuration, the validator is able to check the syntax, as well as various rules and requirements that are placed on an XRechnung, for its correctness and keep a record of the status of the check in the form of a check report.</description>
