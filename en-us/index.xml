        <description>Buyer reference The buyer reference represents an identifier that uniquely identifies a customer.
The XRechnung standard uses the concept of the Leitweg-Id for addressing public sector customers.
You can read more about the Leitweg-Id below.
In principle, however, the XRechnung standard can also be used in the non-public sector.
Here, usually no Leitweg-Ids are used, but own identifiers.
Leitweg-Id The Leitweg-Id must be indicated on every electronic invoice sent to public-sector customers of the federal administration.</description>

For this customer group, the use of the app is included in the maintenance costs.
A test phase is therefore also unnecessary, especially as the app is ideally only used once.</description>

        <description>Setup Adding default attachments per report Default attachments are a great way to save time when adding files to your emails. If you use the same attachment in every email, just add it as a default and it will be automatically attached to every email.
Start by opening the report selection of the report you want, in this example we will use Sales and Invoices. If you are not sure where to find the report selector, you can always use the Dynamics 365 Business Central search feature.</description>

Function âShow passwordâ Of course, it is important that passwords remain protected - however, it can happen that passwords are forgotten or misplaced. For this case there is a function &amp;ldquo;Show password&amp;rdquo; - this function, which can be assigned on a user basis, allows to view the password of PDF files.</description>

(Using without target and communication matrix) The Connector NAV / 365 BC works analogously to the standard dispatch. We will use various examples to explain how the mail dispatch process works. For the following 3 examples we limit ourselves to the report Quotations. The service recipient is the same as the invoice recipient. The process is the same for each report.</description>

        <description>Routing ID As mentioned earlier, the routing ID is used to uniquely identify invoice recipients to enable addressing and, if necessary, routing of electronic invoices to the correct administrative units. Basically, a routing ID consists of the following components:
Coarse addressing
Fine addressing (optional)
Check digit
Further information on the structure of a routing ID can be found here.
The Connector is able to check the syntax of a route ID for correctness.</description>

        <description>SMTP2FAX in Purchase Orders On the purchase orders page, the function can be found in the &amp;ldquo;Print/Send&amp;rdquo; menu.
The fax number used is selected according to the following logic: First, the document layouts of the vendor specified as the recipient are searched for a fax number entered for use with purchase orders. If none is found there, the fax number entered in the supplier&amp;rsquo;s card is used.
The function can also be found on the page of a single purchase order in the &amp;ldquo;Print/Send&amp;rdquo; menu.</description>

        <description>Manual recording of CTI entries Under certain circumstances, there are use cases in which telephone calls are handled outside of STARFACE, e.g. via mobile communication.
In the case of phone calls that are of interest for various business processes, there may be a desire to log them in the same way as STARFACE phone calls.
For this purpose, the Connector 365 CTI for STARFACE app offers a function that allows manual CTI entries to be recorded in the Connector 365 Activities list.</description>

        <description>Communication Matrix Connector NAV&amp;rsquo;s communication matrix was the central setup location to define certain sending parameters, such as destination addresses, for customers and vendors.
In the Connector 365 product line, document layouts from the Microsoft standard are used for the same purposes.
The Connector 365 Base app displays the document layouts under the name Communication Matrix on the list pages and card pages of the customers and vendors:
On this subpage, settings can be set up analogous to the document layouts.</description>

The Joblist logs all activities performed as part of the Connector NAV/BC functions.
The Connector 365 Apps use a similar table (Connector 365 Activities) to record any activities.
However, as the two tables are not identical, a process is required to transfer the data from the Joblist to the Connector 365 Activities list.

Text/CSV (.csv)
Application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheethtml.sheet (.xslx)
Excel tables
Application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.spreadsheet (.ods)
OpenDocument tables
PDF attachments may be considered insecure by some clients and are accordingly marked as such by XRechnung Portal Deutschland. To avoid this, it is recommended to use PDF/A files instead. These have a higher security level and are therefore also classified as secure attachments by the portal.</description>

Now, however, there is a deviating company logic. The service recipient is not the same as the invoice recipient, but a different company. Also the customers/suppliers play a role in the destination address. Despite person contact, there is a desire to send documents but basically to deviating/global addresses.</description>

        <description>Upgrade of communication matrix (CON Communication Matrix) Introduction Please check the prerequisites before proceeding.
The communication matrix of the Connector NAV/BC contains, if maintained, setup data that determines if and how documents for individual customers, vendors or contacts are processed. In the product series Connector 365 (Business Central versions &amp;gt; 14), the communication matrix is no longer available as a separate table.
Instead, the Document Layouts are used for similar facilities.</description>

        <description>Send XRechnung directly by e-mail (Connector e-mail module) If you have also installed the Connector365 module Email, you can send an XRechnung directly by e-mail through the Connector after it has been generated. For this you have to make an adjustment in the communication matrix.
Simply change the value of the Job Mode field from PDF to Email. In addition, you can optionally enter a default destination address. Now the marked invoice can be converted to XRechnung format via the Email button, or via the Batch button, if the batch mode entry has been marked, and sent on directly via e-mail.</description>

        <description>Optimizations: Outlook N-recipient addresses
When storing additional destination addresses, which were neither created as CC nor BCC, the address was previously taken as CC instead of the desired equivalent in the &amp;ldquo;To&amp;rdquo; field. This is now corrected.
Consideration of matrix printers
During batch processing, the additional printers from the communication matrix were not taken into account in the Print job mode. Now it is possible to use these printers as well.</description>

        <description>Analyze validation results in case of error During the validation of the XRechnung file, it can of course also happen that an XRechnung is classified as non-compliant. This happens when important information is missing from the invoice. For example, validation will fail even if the customer&amp;rsquo;s city is not specified.
To simulate a case where validation fails, we modify the above procedure to &amp;ldquo;forget&amp;rdquo; to specify a routing ID. To do this, we again open the Communication Matrix for our example calculation 103003, and remove the value for the route ID.</description>

        <description>Set up your own validator As already mentioned in the XRechnung section of the documentation, BELWARE&amp;rsquo;s XRechnung module uses a service to validate invoices and credit notes in XRechnung format. Here, a configurable XML validation tool is used, which was published for the first time by KoSIT (Koordinierungsstelle fÃ¼r IT).
In combination with the appropriate configuration, the validator is able to check the syntax, as well as various rules and requirements that are placed on an XRechnung, for its correctness and keep a record of the status of the check in the form of a check report.</description>
