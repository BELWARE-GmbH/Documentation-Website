[{"content":"Setup Ident ID The Ident ID must be indicated on every electronic invoice sent to public-sector customers of the federal administration.\nThe Ident ID is intended to enable addressing and, if necessary, forwarding of the received electronic invoice to the downstream invoice processing systems of the connected administrative units. In order to optimize acceptance and manageability both for public-sector customers and for their service providers and their service providers, the federal and state governments have agreed on a uniform system as part of the operation of the XRechnung standard.\nThe Ident ID is basically made up of three components::\n Rough addressing, Fine addressing and Checksum.  The so-called rough addressing is used to distinguish whether the invoice recipient belongs to the federal administration or to a federal state:\n 991: The invoice recipient is part of the direct federal administration or a constitutional body and receives electronic invoices via the ZRE. 992:\na) The invoice recipient is part of the indirect federal administration and receives electronic invoices via the OZG-RE.\nb) The invoice recipient is a federal state that receives electronic invoices via the OZG-RE. 993: The invoice recipient is part of the indirect federal administration and receives electronic invoices via its own solution (neither ZRE nor OZG-RE).  Example structure of an Ident ID: 123-456-76\nAn invoice recipient of the federal administration has at least one Ident ID.\nThe design of the Ident ID in an authority is based on the organization of internal invoice processing. Authorities with several routing IDs ensure that the invoice is addressed directly to the area responsible for management by specifying the corresponding routing IDs. It is therefore essential that the Ident ID specified in the order is always used for invoicing.\nThe Ident IDs are assigned decentrally by the federal and state governments. Therefore, there is currently no nationwide database in which all Ident IDs are entered.\nYou will receive the Ident ID exclusively from the respective invoice recipient.\n","description":"","id":0,"section":"Connector on AppSource","tags":null,"title":"Ident ID","uri":"http://docs.belware.de/en-us/connector-on-appsource/xrechnung/first-steps/setup/setup-ident-id/"},{"content":"FAQ What is the Ident ID?

This format is an XML-based data model that is currently being established as the standard for electronic invoices.\nAccording to the Decision of the IT Planning Council of 22.06.2017 (Link only available in German), XRechnung is decisive for the implementation of the Directive 2014/55/EU (Link only available in German) in Germany. XRechnung thus forms a reliable basis for the exchange of electronic invoices from and with German administrations.\nThe XRechnung standard is operated by KoSIT on behalf of the IT Planning Council and consists of various components that support technical implementation. The standard was developed by experts from the federal, state and local governments as part of the eRechnung steering project.\nValidity period The following table provides an overview of the validity periods of the individual versions of the standard. Only the currently valid version is to be used.\n   XRechnung-Version Version from Validity period     2.0.1 16.12.2020 from 01.07.2021   2.0.0 30.06.2020 01.01.2021 - 30.06.2021   1.2.2 19.12.2019 01.07.2020 - 31.12.2020   1.2.1 28.06.2019 01.01.2019 - 30.06.2020   1.2.0 18.12.2018 01.07.2019 - 31.12.2019   1.1 30.11.2017 01.12.2017 - 30.06.2019   1.0 10.05.2017 01.06.2017 - 30.11.2017    ","description":"","id":2,"section":"Connector on AppSource","tags":null,"title":"Introduction","uri":"http://docs.belware.de/en-us/connector-on-appsource/xrechnung/first-steps/introduction/"},{"content":"Working with XRechnung Sending If the setup has been completed, then you can easily send invoices by email.
